## Description

This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using:

- **YOLOv8** for accurate and fast object detection  
- **DeepSORT** for multi-object tracking with consistent IDs  
- **Tkinter GUI** for easy interaction with Start and Stop controls  

The system captures live video from your webcam, detects objects in each frame, tracks them across frames, and displays the video with bounding boxes and unique IDs in a GUI window.

## Features

- Real-time object detection and tracking using state-of-the-art models  
- Lightweight YOLOv8n model for fast inference  
- DeepSORT tracker to maintain object identities over time  
- Simple and clean GUI using Tkinter  
- Start and stop webcam feed with buttons
